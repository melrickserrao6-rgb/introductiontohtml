                <p>
                    Dogs have a sense of time but don’t understand the ‘concept’ of time. Unlike

humans, dogs don’t have the ability to create actual measures of time, like

the second, hour, and minute, and they don’t know how to read clocks. So,

telling them ”I’ll be back in 15 minutes” won’t really do much, but we

understand that you feel like you have to do it anyway! Dogs are capable

of being trained based on past events, and can be taught to anticipate

future events based on past experiences. Pavlov’s dogs are the perfect example of this.
